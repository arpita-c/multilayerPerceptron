The comparison between Perceptron, Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression
is as mentioned below (all numbers are after removing stop words):

Average Accuracy of Perceptron: 93.6778%
Average Acuracy of Naive Bayes: 94.3515%
Average Acuracy of Logistic Regression: 82.4268%

From the above data, it can be observed that Perceptron network and
Naive Bayes almost equivalent accuracies while Logistic Regression has
a far lower accuracy.
